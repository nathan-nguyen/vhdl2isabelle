Fixed:

(V2I-000) Constant in pre.vhd are not included when parsing main vhd file
Example in pre.vhd:
constant IDBITS : integer := 32;
IDBITS is defined in pre.vhd but cannot be used in main vhd file

(V2I-001) Separators between signalList, portList, variableList, vnlList declaration are not display correctly when one of these list is empty

(V2I-002) Cannot declare record with element that has range is defined by a constant
Example:
constant IDBITS : integer := 32;
type icache_out_type is record
  diagdata         : std_logic_vector(IDBITS-1 downto 0);  -- diagnostic data
end record;

(V2I-003) Operator not correct
Example:
constant IDBITS : integer := 32;
type icache_out_type is record
  diagdata         : std_logic_vector(IDBITS-1 downto 0);  -- diagnostic data
end record;
To Isabelle -> 32
type icache_out_type is record
  diagdata         : std_logic_vector(IDBITS+1 downto 0);  -- diagnostic data
end record;
To Isabelle -> 34
