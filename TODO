- exp_tl, exp_trl
- remove function (preprocessing)
- serialize
- sometimes we are not sure who has the correct "ExpKind" (for ExpVectorKind) or "ValType"
  this should be modified in "toIExp" functions of the relevant "V" classes OR the higher level statements
- can we prove that as long as "IExp" is a variable like, it is always ValType??? perhaps adding a "trust" field
